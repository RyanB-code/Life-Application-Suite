# Life-Application-Suite
A way for me to practice and learn programming and software development by making a useful central place for me to track important aspects of my life such as vehicle maintenance, workout progress, things I need to do or get from the store, etc.


GUI Branch Specifc, from here on, the goals on the LAS have changed slightly. 

Priorities of work
1. Get all aspects of the Vehicle Manager working with Dear ImGUI
2. Support for MacOS, Windows, and linux.
3. Debug and release Version 1.0 with just the Vehicle Manager as the module.
4. Add other modules
